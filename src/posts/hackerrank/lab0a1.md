#### Problem Statement

Those who frequent pubs and clubs will know that some clubs impose entry requirements. A particular club in Singapore admits only men who are at least 23 years old and ladies who are at least 18 years old.

Write a program to check if a male or female person of a certain age qualifies to enter this club. Get your input from STDIN and output your answer to STDOUT.

#### Input Format

The character 'M' or 'F' (without quotes), followed by a space, and the age as an integer.

#### Output Format

True or False

#### Constraints

Input: x y where x is an element in ['M' , 'F'], and y is an integer

#### Solution Approach

The program checks the **sex** and **age** conditions as follows:

1. **If sex == "F" and age > 17 **, return True.
2. **If sex == "M" and age > 22 **, return True.
3. **Otherwise, return False. **

### Code Implementation

```python
sex, age = input().split()
age = int(age)

if sex == "F" and age > 17:
    print(True)
elif sex == "M" and age > 22:
    print(True)
else:
    print(False)
```
